My DotFiles Accross Machines (Mac & WSL)

- Managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
- Mostly use [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)...even with Linux on WSL2, for a bit of consistency
- Using a Neovim Distro,[NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), but perhaps will go vanilla soon.
- Also heavily relying on [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- Plus other tools...
